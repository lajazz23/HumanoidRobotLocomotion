#  How Training Works in Isaac Lab

Training can be initiated using the built-in `train.py` file. Trained models are saved after a set number of steps as checkpoints, which can be resumed for training or viewed using `play.py`.

## Initiating Training

```
python scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train.py --task=Isaac-Velocity-Rough-G1-v0
```
